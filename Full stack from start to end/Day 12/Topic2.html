        <p>I am a basic block level element . MY adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me</p>
        <p>By Default we span 100% of the width of our parent element and we are as tall as our child content our total 
            widh and heiight is our content + padding+ border width/height
        </p>
        <p>
            we are separated by our margins , Because of margin collapsing we are separated by the width of one of our margins
        </p>

            inline element <span> like this one </span> sit on the same line along with adjacent text nodes if there is space on the same line.
            overflowing inline elements will <span>wrap onto a new line if possible </span>
