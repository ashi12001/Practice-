# Recursion 

##  *Recursion basics*


>Recursion is used in graph , trees and Dp  ,  Things which we can do with loop can be performed Recursively TOo 


* **Recursion can be beneficial in some scenerios and same goes for loops too** 

* function calling itself is recursion  
    Example -  factorial  of n =  n * factorial of n-1
               factorial of n-1 =  n-1 * factorial of n-2

* f[5] = 5 * f[4] -> 4 * f[3]-> 3 * f[2]-> 2 * f[1]
