          In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web
          pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors
          available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements
          to style. In this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the
          different types in great detail, seeing how they work.

        <p class="para2">
          A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of
          elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements
          should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule
          applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the
          selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.
        </p>
        <p class="para3"> 
          If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the
          individual selectors can be combined into a selector list so that the
          rule is applied to all of the <em>individual</em> selectors. For example, if I
          have the same CSS for an h1 and also a class of .special, I could
          write this as two separate rules.
